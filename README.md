### About
This project was part of [FreeCodeCamp's](www.freecodecamp.org) Front End Certificate. This is a simple app that takes in a user's input (a keyword) and uses Wikipedia's API to search for matching article titles allowing users 
to click on a title/description which will then pull up the Wiki article. Users can also choose to view a randomly generated Wiki article.

To view the app, click [here](https://shannonj498.github.io/wiki-viewer/).
